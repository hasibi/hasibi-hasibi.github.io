I am an assistant professor of information retrieval at the [Institute of Computing and Information Sciences](https://www.ru.nl/icis/) (iCIS) at the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/). My general research interest lies in the intersection of Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, with the primary focus in conversational AI and semantic search systems. In particular, I am interested in knowledge grounded  conversational search, entity linking and retrieval, and utilizing knowledge graphs for semantic search tasks.

Before joining iCIS, I was working at [ASML](https://www.asml.com/asml/en/s427), researching and developing machine learning solutions for the IC manufacturing industry. I obtained my PhD in Computer and Information Science from the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu) (NTNU), under the supervision of prof. [Krisztian Balog](http://krisztianbalog.com/ and prof. [Svein Erik Bratsberg](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/sveinbra).  In 2013, I was an intern at Yahoo! lab Barcelona, working on cross domain entity disambiguation.

Research interests:

Conversational  AI; Semantic search; Natural language processing
